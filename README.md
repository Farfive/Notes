The Notes App is a Kotlin-based Android application built using Jetpack Compose and follows the MVVM architectural pattern. It provides a simple and intuitive user interface for managing and organizing notes using CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The app utilizes an SQL database to store and retrieve note data efficiently.

## Features

- Create new notes with a title and content.
- Read and view existing notes with their respective details.
- Update and edit note titles and contents.
- Delete unwanted or no longer needed notes.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: The application is developed using the Kotlin programming language, which is the official language for Android development.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Jetpack Compose is used for building the modern and declarative user interface.
- **MVVM Architecture**: The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, separating concerns and providing a clean code structure.
- **SQL Database**: The app uses an SQL database to store and retrieve note data efficiently, providing persistent storage for the application.
- **CRUD Operations**: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are implemented to allow users to manage their notes effectively.
